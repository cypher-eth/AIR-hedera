# CREDIT Balance and Swap Issues - Complete Solution

## Problem Summary

1. **CREDIT Balance Issue**: Users seeing "0.00000000040000001 CREDITS" instead of expected "4 CREDITS"
2. **GM NFT Issue**: Users receiving dust amounts instead of 10 CREDITS for GM minting
3. **Swap Issue**: WATER contract not minting correct amounts

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. GMNFT Contract Bug
- **Issue**: `CREDIT_PER_MINT = 10` was minting 10 wei instead of 10 CREDITS
- **Fix**: Changed to `CREDIT_PER_MINT = 10 * 1e18` to mint 10 full CREDITS

### 2. WATER Contract Logic
- **Issue**: Contract logic was correct, but old deployment was being used
- **Fix**: Redeploy with correct conversion rate and logic

### 3. Frontend Display
- **Issue**: `formatCredits` function was working correctly, but receiving wrong amounts
- **Fix**: No changes needed to frontend - issue was in contract logic

## Complete Solution Steps

### Step 1: Deploy Fixed Contracts

```bash
# Deploy all contracts with fixes
forge script script/DeployFixed.s.sol --rpc-url hedera_testnet --broadcast --gas-limit 60000000
```

### Step 2: Update Contract Addresses

After deployment, update `app/constants/contracts.ts` with new addresses:

```typescript
// Update with new deployment addresses
export const CREDIT_ADDRESS = '0x[NEW_CREDIT_ADDRESS]';
export const GMNFT_ADDRESS = '0x[NEW_GMNFT_ADDRESS]';
export const WATER_ADDRESS = '0x[NEW_WATER_ADDRESS]';
```

### Step 3: Verify Contract Logic

The fixed contracts will have:

1. **GMNFT Contract**:
   - `CREDIT_PER_MINT = 10 * 1e18` (10 CREDITS per mint)
   - Proper minting logic

2. **WATER Contract**:
   - `conversionRate = 100 * 1e18` (100 CREDITS per 1 HBAR)
   - Correct calculation: `(msg.value * conversionRate) / 1e18`

3. **CREDIT Contract**:
   - Standard ERC20 with 18 decimals
   - Proper minting and balance tracking

### Step 4: Test the Fix

1. **Test GM Minting**:
   - Mint a GM NFT
   - Should receive 10 CREDITS (not dust)

2. **Test HBAR Swap**:
   - Buy 0.04 HBAR worth of CREDITS
   - Should receive 4 CREDITS (not 0.00000000040000001)

3. **Test Balance Display**:
   - Balance should show "4 CREDITS" not "0.00000000040000001 CREDITS"

## Expected Results

### Before Fix:
- GM minting: 0.00000000000000001 CREDITS (dust)
- 0.04 HBAR swap: 0.00000000040000001 CREDITS (dust)
- Balance display: Shows dust amounts

### After Fix:
- GM minting: 10 CREDITS
- 0.04 HBAR swap: 4 CREDITS
- Balance display: Shows correct human-readable amounts

## Verification Commands

### Test Contract Logic:
```bash
# Test WATER contract calculation
forge test --match-test testWaterContractCalculation -vvv

# Test GMNFT minting
forge test --match-test testCompleteUserFlow -vvv
```

### Check Contract Addresses:
```bash
# Verify contract addresses in constants
cat app/constants/contracts.ts
```

## Troubleshooting

### If Issues Persist:

1. **Clear Browser Cache**: Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. **Check Network**: Ensure connected to Hedera Testnet (Chain ID: 296)
3. **Verify Addresses**: Confirm using latest contract addresses
4. **Check Console Logs**: Look for debug information in browser console

### Common Issues:

1. **Old Contract Addresses**: Update `app/constants/contracts.ts`
2. **Browser Caching**: Clear cache and hard refresh
3. **Network Issues**: Check RPC connection
4. **Gas Issues**: Ensure sufficient gas for transactions

## Success Criteria

✅ GM NFT minting gives 10 CREDITS
✅ 0.04 HBAR swap gives 4 CREDITS  
✅ Balance displays correctly (e.g., "4 CREDITS")
✅ No more dust amounts
✅ All transactions work smoothly
